    "- First, you should attempt the **take home** exercises provided in the [notebook](https://github.com/omarsar/data_mining_lab/blob/master/news_data_mining.ipynb) we used for the first lab session. Attempt all the exercises, as it is counts towards the final grade of your first assignment (20%). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, download the dataset provided in this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences#). The sentiment dataset contains a `sentence` and `score` label. Read the specificiations of the dataset before you start exploring it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, you are asked to apply each of the data exploration and data operation steps learned in the [first lab session](https://github.com/omarsar/data_mining_lab) on **the new dataset**. You don't need to explain all the procedures as we did in the notebook, but you are expected to provide some **minimal comments** explaining your code. You are also expected to use the same libraries used in the first lab session. You are allowed to use and modify the `helper` functions we provided in the first lab session or create your own. Also, be aware that the helper functions may need modification as you are dealing with a completely different dataset. This part is worth 30% of your grade!\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to applying the same operations from the first lab, we are asking that you attempt the following tasks on the new sentiment dataset as well (40%):\n",
    "    - Use your creativity and imagination to generate **new data visualizations**. Refer to online resources and the Data Mining textbook for inspiration and ideas. \n",
    "    - Generate **TF-IDF features** from the tokens of each text. Refer to this Sciki-learn [guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) on how you may go about doing this. Keep in mind that you are generating a matrix similar to the term-document matrix we implemented in our first lab session. However, the weights will be computed differently and should represent the TF-IDF value of each word per document as opposed to the word frequency.\n",
    "    - Using both the TF-IDF and word frequency features, try to compute the **similarity** between random sentences and report results. Read the \"distance simiilarity\" section of the Data Mining textbook on what measures you can use here. [Cosine similarity](https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/the-cosine-similarity-of-two-sentences/) is one of these methods but there are others. Try to explore a few of them in this exercise and report the differences in result. \n",
    "    - Lastly, implement a simple **Naive Bayes classifier** that automatically classifies the records into their categories. Try to implement this using scikit-learn built in classifiers and use both the TF-IDF features and word frequency features to build two seperate classifiers. Refer to this [nice article](https://hub.packtpub.com/implementing-3-naive-bayes-classifiers-in-scikit-learn/) on how to build this type of classifier using scikit-learn. Report the classification accuracy of both your models. If you are struggling with this step please reach us on Slack as soon as possible.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presentation matters! You are also expected to **tidy up your notebook** and attempt new data operations and techniques that you have learned so far in the Data Mining course. Surprise us! This segment is worth 10% of your grade. The idea of this exercise is to begin thinking of how you will program the concepts you have learned and the process that is involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- After completing all the above tasks, you are free to remove this header block and **submit** your assignment following the guide provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/omarsar/dm_2018_hw_1/blob/master/README.md) file of the assignment's repository. "

      "Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  \t0\n",
      "Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  \t0\n",
      "Very little music or anything to speak of.  \t0\n",
      "The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  \t1\n",
      "The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  \t0\n",
      "Wasted two hours.  \t0\n",
      "Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  \t1\n",
      "A bit predictable.  \t0\n",
      "Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  \t1\n",

      "The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  \t1\n",
      "The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  \t1\n",
      "It Was So Cool.  \t1\n",
      "This is a very \"right on case\" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  \t1\n",
      "It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  \t0\n",
      "This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  \t1\n",
      "I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  \t1\n",
      "It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux \"masterpieces.  \t1\n",
      "\" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \t1\n",
      "I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \t1\n",
      "In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \t1\n",
      "How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \t1\n",
      "It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \t1\n",
      "Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \t1\n",
      "This short film certainly pulls no punches.  \t0\n",
      "Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  \t0\n",
      "This is the number one best TH game in the series.  \t1\n",
      "It deserves strong love.  \t1\n",

      "Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \t1\n",
      "It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  \t1\n",
      "This was a flick doomed from its conception.  \t0\n",
      "The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \t0\n",
      "I wasn't the least bit interested.  \t0\n",
      "Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \t0\n",
      "But it's just not funny.  \t0\n",
      "But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  \t0\n",
      "His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \t0\n",
      "The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \t0\n",
      "The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  \t0\n",
      "But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  \t0\n",
      "The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \t1\n",
      "I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \t1\n",
      "In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \t1\n",
      "It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \t1\n",
      "On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \t0\n",
      "Long, whiny and pointless.  \t0\n",
      "But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \t0\n",
      "Excellent cast, story line, performances.  \t1\n",
      "Totally believable.  \t1\n",
      "Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  \t1\n",
      "Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \t1\n",
      "I sat riveted to the TV screen.  \t1\n",
      "All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \t1\n",

      "I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \t1\n",
      "I was very disappointed in the movie.  \t0\n",
      "One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \t0\n",
      "There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \t0\n",
      "There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \t0\n",
      "This movie totally grates on my nerves.  \t0\n",
      "The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \t0\n",
      "And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \t0\n",
      "Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \t0\n",
      "It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \t0\n",
      "There are some generally great things in it.  \t1\n",
      "I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \t0\n",
      "The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \t1\n",
      "I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \t1\n",
      "If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \t1\n",
      "Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  \t1\n",
      "He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \t1\n",
      "I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained \"movie business\" of Québec.  \t0\n",
      "This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  \t1\n",
      "If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  \t1\n",
      "Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  \t1\n",
      "Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  \t1\n",
      "Give this one a look.  \t1\n",
      "I gave it a 10  \t1\n",
      "The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  \t1\n",
      "It is a true classic.  \t1\n",
      "It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  \t1\n",
      "Definitely worth checking out.  \t1\n",
      "The problem was the script.  \t0\n",
      "It was horrendous.  \t0\n",
      "There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  \t0\n",
      "The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  \t0\n",
      "MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  \t1\n",
      "The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  \t1\n",
      "The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  \t1\n",
      "Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  \t1\n",
      "If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of \"The Way You Look Tonight\"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  \t1\n",
      "I don't think you will be disappointed.  \t1\n",
      "Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  \t0\n",
      "The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  \t0\n",
      "It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  \t0\n",
      "Too politically correct.  \t0\n",
      "Very disappointing.  \t0\n",
      "The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  \t1\n",
      "I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  \t0\n",
      "An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  \t0\n",
      "But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  \t1\n",
      "The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  \t1\n",
      "The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  \t0\n",
      "The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  \t0\n",
      "), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  \t0\n",
      "The directing seems too pretentious.  \t0\n",
      "The scenes with the \"oh-so-mature\" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  \t0\n",
      "And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \t0\n",
      "Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  \t0\n",
      "Some applause should be given to the \"prelude\" however.  \t1\n",
      "I really liked that.  \t1\n",
      "A great film by a great director.  \t1\n",
      "The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  \t1\n",
      "The music in the film is really nice too.  \t1\n",
      "I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  \t1\n",
      "Brilliant!  \t1\n",
      "10/10  \t1\n",
      "I liked this movie way too much.  \t1\n",
      "My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  \t0\n",
      "It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  \t1\n",
      "However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  \t0\n",
      "There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  \t0\n",
      "There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  \t0\n",
      "This was a poor remake of \"My Best Friends Wedding\".  \t0\n",
      "All in all, a great disappointment.  \t0\n",
      "I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this \"film\".  \t0\n",
      "I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  \t0\n",
      "I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  \t0\n",
      "IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  \t0\n",
      "I saw \"Mirrormask\" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  \t0\n",
      "Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  \t0\n",
      "These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  \t0\n",
      "All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  \t0\n",
      "It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  \t0\n",
      "You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  \t0\n",
      "This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  \t1\n",
      "This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  \t0\n",
      "The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  \t0\n",
      "A truly, truly bad film.  \t0\n",
      "The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  \t0\n",
      "The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  \t0\n",
      "I paid too much.  \t0\n",
      "Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  \t1\n",
      "It was so BORING!  \t0\n",
      "No plot whatsoever!  \t0\n",
      "Again, no plot at all.  \t0\n",
      "Horrible!  \t0\n",
      "Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  \t0\n",
      "I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  \t0\n",
      "I hate movies like that.  \t0\n",
      "Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  \t0\n",
      "THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  \t0\n",
      "If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  \t0\n",
      "Awful.  \t0\n",
      "I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  \t0\n",
      "It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \t0\n",
      "NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  \t0\n",
      "This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  \t0\n",
      "Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  \t0\n",
      "Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  \t1\n",
      "Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  \t0\n",
      "I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \t0\n",
      "This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  \t0\n",
      "I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \t0\n",
      "I mean this in a terrible way.  \t0\n",
      "This film has no redeeming features.  \t0\n",
      "Everything is appalling.  \t0\n",
      "Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  \t0\n",
      "The story is beyond stupid.  \t0\n",
      "The script is",
      "was there a script?  \t0\n",
      "The kids are annoying.  \t0\n",
      "The lead man is charisma-free.  \t0\n",
      "Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  \t0\n",
      "I'll even say it again  this is torture.  \t0\n",
      "Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  \t0\n",
      "Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  \t0\n",
      "Highly unrecommended.  \t0\n",
      "If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  \t0\n",
      "Yes, it's that bad.  \t0\n",
      "Nothing at all to recommend.  \t0\n",
      "An excellent performance from Ms.  \t1\n",
      "Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  \t1\n",
      "It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  \t1\n",
      "This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  \t0\n",
      "There were too many close ups.  \t0\n",
      "But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  \t0\n",
      "But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  \t0\n",

      "This is definitely one of the bad ones.  \t0\n",
      "The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  \t1\n",
      "John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  \t1\n",
      "His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  \t1\n",
      "I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  \t1\n",
      "I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  \t0\n",
      "I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  \t0\n",
      "It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  \t0\n",
      "Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  \t0\n",
      "Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  \t1\n",
      "His performance is simply genius.  \t1\n",
      "He owns the film, just as Spacek owned \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" and Quaid owned \"Great Balls of Fire.  \t1\n",

      "The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \t1\n",
      "Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \t1\n",

      "Don't miss it.  \t1\n",
      "This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \t1\n",
      "A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \t1\n",
      "But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \t1\n",
      "It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  \t1\n",
      "The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \t0\n",

      "But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  \t1\n",
      "I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  \t1\n",
      "I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \t0\n",
      "He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  \t0\n",
      "Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \t1\n",
      "Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  \t1\n",
      "Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  \t1\n",
      "I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  \t1\n",

      "Overall, a delight!  \t1\n",
      "This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  \t0\n",
      "The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \t0\n",
      "The least said about the acting the better.  \t0\n",
      "This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \t1\n",

      "If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \t1\n",
      "This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \t1\n",
      "Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \t1\n",
      "However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film \"about\" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \t1\n",
      "Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \t1\n",
      "Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \t0\n",
      "Unless you're just out to visually \"collect\" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  \t0\n",

      "It is not good.  \t0\n",
      "Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  \t0\n",

      "This is a stunning movie.  \t1\n",
      "Raw and sublimely moving.  \t1\n",
      "It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \t1\n",
      "All of the main players are mesmerising.  \t1\n",
